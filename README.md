# ml5-with-vuejs
Hello there! This project attached ml5 and p5 libraries in a VueJs environment with the aim of recognize several pose detections in the body through the use of the webcam. In addition, the "post" verb was implemented to send different data to a database like personal information and the anatomical points position from the user.
Enjoy it ;)
